## Getting Test Powers

Becoming a tester is a fairly straight forward process:

```
$ give me test-powers
```

{% hint style="info" %}
 Test-powers are granted randomly so please submit an issue if you're not happy with yours.
{% endhint %}

Once you're tested enough, save the world:

```
// Ain't no code for that yet, sorry
echo 'You got to trust me on this, I tested the world'
